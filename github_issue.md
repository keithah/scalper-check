# üö® URGENT: False notifications still being sent for unverified Viagogo tickets

## Problem Summary
The monitoring system is still sending false urgent alerts and test notifications for unverified Viagogo tickets that show misleading prices, despite multiple attempted fixes.

## Current Issues

### 1. **False Urgent Alerts Still Being Sent**
```
üö® URGENT TICKET ALERT!
Found 2 premium tickets under $300

Premium Tickets Under $300 - ACT FAST!
Location    Section    Price    Qty    Seller    Verified    Buy Now
Right Sections
Right    Front Right    $293    1    vgg    ‚ùì    Buy Now
Other Sections
Other    Reserved Seating    $100    1    vgg    ‚ùì    Buy Now
```

### 2. **False Test Notifications**
```
Found 3 premium tickets under $400

Premium Tickets Under $400
Location    Section    Price    Qty    Seller    Verified    Buy Now
Left Sections
Left    Front Left    $328    1    vgg    ‚ùì    Buy Now
Right Sections
Right    Front Right    $293    1    vgg    ‚ùì    Buy Now
Other Sections
Other    Reserved Seating    $100    1    vgg    ‚ùì    Buy Now
```

### 3. **Severe Pricing Discrepancies (Bait-and-Switch)**

#### Viagogo Price Verification Failures:
- **Front Right $293 ‚Üí Actually $396** (+35% hidden fees)
  - Screenshot shows "1 x US$ 396" on Viagogo checkout
  - SeatPick misleadingly shows $293
  - System shows ‚ùì unverified instead of extracting real price

- **Front Left $328 ‚Üí Actually $442** (+35% hidden fees)  
  - User confirmed actual checkout price is $442
  - System shows ‚ùì unverified

- **Reserved Seating $100 ‚Üí Likely $150+** (unverified)
  - Suspiciously low price for premium seating
  - System shows ‚ùì unverified

#### TicketNetwork Issues (Previously Fixed):
- ~~**$104 (listed: $545)**~~ ‚úÖ FIXED - Now filtered out
- ~~**$130 (listed: $680)**~~ ‚úÖ FIXED - Now filtered out

### 4. **Quantity Issues**
- All tickets showing **Qty: 1** when user needs **2 tickets together**
- Tickets should be filtered out if only 1 available
- Screenshot shows "Only 2 tickets left at this price" but defaults to quantity 1

## Root Causes Analysis

### 1. **Viagogo Price Extraction Completely Failing**
- Pattern matching not finding "1 x US$ 396" format
- Returns `Final=$None` in logs
- Falls back to misleading SeatPick price ($293 vs real $396)

### 2. **Conservative Filtering Not Applied in Production**
- Latest commits with fixes not deployed to GitHub Actions
- Old version still running that sends unverified alerts

### 3. **Insufficient Quantity Filtering**
- Logic allows tickets with quantity=2 but defaulting to 1
- Should require confirmed ability to purchase 2 together

## Fix History & Current Status

### ‚úÖ **Applied Fixes (Awaiting Deployment)**

#### Commit `f39b2e0`: Stop all unverified notifications
```python
# OLD: Allowed unverified tickets in test notifications
test_tickets = [t for t in tickets if t['price'] < 400]

# NEW: Conservative filtering for ALL notifications  
if t.get('verified') or 'vividseats' in t.get('seller', '').lower():
    test_tickets.append(t)
else:
    print(f"Skipping unverified test notification: {t['section']} ${t['price']} via {t['seller']}")
```

#### Commit `57d3b2d`: Eliminate false urgent alerts
```python
# Only allow urgent alerts for verified accurate prices or VividSeats
# NO unverified tickets from Viagogo/TicketNetwork in urgent alerts
if (t.get('verified') and t.get('accurate')) or \
   'vividseats' in t.get('seller', '').lower():
    immediate_tickets.append(t)
```

#### Commit `33f6671`: Conservative filtering
- Enhanced TicketNetwork price extraction (working)
- Improved Viagogo patterns (still failing)

### üîÑ **Working Systems**
- **VividSeats verification**: ‚úÖ $269‚Üí$426.39, $277‚Üí$437.56  
- **TicketNetwork filtering**: ‚úÖ No longer sends false alerts
- **Quantity filtering**: ‚úÖ Basic logic working

### ‚ùå **Still Broken**
- **Viagogo price extraction**: Completely failing
- **Production deployment**: Old code still running

## Technical Details

### Current Viagogo Extraction Patterns (Not Working)
```python
patterns = [
    r'(?:Total|total|TOTAL)[\s\:]*\$(\d+(?:\.\d{2})?)',
    r'(?:You Pay|You pay|YOU PAY)[\s\:]*\$(\d+(?:\.\d{2})?)',
    r'(?:Final Price|Final price|FINAL PRICE)[\s\:]*\$(\d+(?:\.\d{2})?)',
    # MISSING: Pattern for "1 x US$ 396" format
]
```

### Needed Pattern Additions
```python
# Add these patterns for Viagogo
r'1 x US\$ (\d+)',  # Matches "1 x US$ 396"  
r'(\d+) x US\$ (\d+)',  # Matches "2 x US$ 396"
r'US\$ (\d+)',  # Generic US dollar amounts
```

### Debug Logs Show
```
Price extraction result: SeatPick=$293, Final=$None
Extracting from Viagogo/Events365 page...
No reliable Viagogo price found
```

## Immediate Action Items

### 1. **URGENT: Deploy Latest Fixes**
```bash
# Trigger GitHub Actions with latest code
gh workflow run "Atmosphere Morrison Ticket Monitor" --field run_type=alert
```

### 2. **Fix Viagogo Price Extraction**
File: `premium_monitor.py` lines 271-305

Add patterns to extract real checkout prices:
```python
# Add to Viagogo patterns array
r'1 x US\$ (\d+)',
r'(\d+) x US\$ (\d+)',  
r'Order summary[\s\S]*?US\$ (\d+)',
```

### 3. **Strengthen Quantity Verification**
Ensure tickets requiring quantity selection are filtered out.

### 4. **Add Debugging**
Enhance logging to see exactly what's on Viagogo pages:
```python
print(f"Viagogo page content sample: {content[:500]}")
```

## Expected Results After Complete Fix

### Immediate (After Deployment):
```
üìä Found X premium tickets  
   Skipping unverified test notification: Front Right $293 via vgg
   Skipping unverified test notification: Reserved Seating $100 via vgg
   Skipping unverified urgent alert: Front Right $293 via vgg
üìß Test range (<$400): 0 tickets
üö® Alert range (<$300): 0 tickets
```

### Long-term (After Viagogo Fix):
- Viagogo $293 ‚Üí Shows real $396 (filtered out as > $300)
- Only genuine verified deals under thresholds generate alerts
- All prices include fees (no bait-and-switch)

## Files Requiring Changes
- `premium_monitor.py` - Main monitoring logic (lines 271-305)
- `.github/workflows/ticket-monitor.yml` - Deployment automation
- `README.md` - Update with current accuracy stats

## Test Commands
```bash
# Test locally
source venv/bin/activate && python3 premium_monitor.py

# Check filtering is working  
python3 premium_monitor.py | grep -E "Skipping unverified|Alert range"

# Check specific ticket extraction
python3 debug_specific_tickets.py
```

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] No urgent alerts for unverified tickets
- [ ] No test notifications for unverified tickets  
- [ ] Viagogo prices extracted correctly ($396 not $293)
- [ ] Only tickets with 2+ available quantity shown
- [ ] All notifications show verified pricing with fees

## Priority: CRITICAL
This is causing false urgent alerts every 5 minutes and undermining the entire monitoring system's credibility.
