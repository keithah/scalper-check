# 🎫 Atmosphere Morrison Red Rocks Ticket Monitor

An intelligent ticket monitoring system that tracks premium seating for Atmosphere Morrison at Red Rocks Amphitheatre (September 19, 2025) with **verified pricing** to prevent bait-and-switch fee scams.

## 🚨 Why This Monitor Exists

Popular ticket aggregators like SeatPick display misleading prices that don't include fees. For example:
- **VividSeats** shows $314 → **Actually costs $426.39** (+35% in fees!)
- **VividSeats** shows $323 → **Actually costs $437.56** (+35% in fees!)

This monitor **verifies actual checkout prices** to ensure you only get alerts for tickets that are truly within your budget.

## ✨ Key Features
